Here is the general OUtline to setting up the Developer Environment for the Hackathon

1) Ignore the startup error within eclipse - it is something to do with networking and is a bug within the VM, it does NOT affect the running of Eclipse
2) Set the Preferences --> GIT remote timeout to 300 seconds
3) Use the text file on the desktop to download the GIT repo into eclipse
4) Explore the cloud service to get the IP address of your NodeDB instance and the Pluggable DB connection string
5) Update the environmentVariables.sh with your IP address and the DB connection string
6) Run the environment variables locally using $source environmentVariables.sh form a terminal window
