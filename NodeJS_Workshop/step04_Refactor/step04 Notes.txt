Step 04

Goal: Split item API into its own separate module

		Create itemAPI.js under step04/scripts/API and cut-paste code from server.js
		Wrap code as a module and export
		Create express route in server.js and load itemAPI.js using 'require'

		Do the same with the connection info, splitting it into a separate dbConfig.js file
		and calling it from itemAPI.js
