Step 12 Notes: 

Goal - Add offer and comments to RHS view. Create additional service and controllers

First fix the 404 error for forSale.jpg by simply copying the file to /images

1. Add offer data to rhs view
		
		a. Check offer api is working
		b. create offer.js services
		c. Make sure offer.js is loaded via index.html
		d. add code to controller to call offer service and populate $scope model
		e. Add proper html in browse.html


2. Add comment data for viewing comments only

	Same as above.


3. Add code in browse.html to make comments	--- can't do that yet since it needs user data
